## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://rmoscoe.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

A user can enter the name of any city in the search field to display the current weather conditions in that city and a five-day forecast. That city is also added to the user's search history, which is saved to local storage. Each city in the search history appears as a button, which shows the current weather and five-day forecast for that city with a single click.
